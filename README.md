Smart Campus Connect is a modern web portal designed to streamline communication and engagement within a campus. Initially built as a responsive website to share announcements, events, feedback, and queries, the project has been enhanced into a Progressive Web App (PWA). By integrating a manifest.json file and a service_worker.js, it now offers offline access, faster loading through caching, and the ability for users to install the portal on their mobile or desktop devices like a native app. With proper icons, splash screen configuration, and SPA-style navigation, the platform delivers a seamless, app-like experience while retaining the simplicity and accessibility of the web. These PWA features significantly improve usability, especially for students accessing information on the go, and make Smart Campus Connect a reliable, engaging, and professional digital tool for campus life.
